Electric_Car_Charge_Scheduling_System
=====================================

HIT3138

This project will use JADE to provide the functionality for the project

For this project we will have a decentralised system where cars will communicate with other car agents in order to get a charging order.

There will be a GUI to allow for controlling the Agents inputs as will as a GUI to view a summary of the slot values.

Later on there will be a way of swapping algorithms and a dynamic power transformer to provide some extra constraints.
